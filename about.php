                    <p>In addition to providing medical services, the Vocal Health and
                        Research Association also conducts research on health
                        issues and advocates for policies that promote rural health. They
                        believe that by raising awareness about the importance of vocal
                        health, they can empower individuals to take control of their own
                        health and wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the Vocal Health and Research Association is a crucial
                        organization that is making a significant impact in the lives of
                        millions of people in rural India. Through their innovative approach
                        to healthcare, they are proving that healthcare access is a basic
                        human right that should be available to everyone, regardless of
                        their socioeconomic status</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the organization is committed to fostering community engagement and education in
                        rural areas. The Vocal
                        Health and Research Association actively organizes workshops and informational sessions to
                        educate individuals about
                        preventive measures for maintaining vocal health. These sessions cover topics such as proper
                        vocal hygiene, the impact
                        of environmental factors on vocal health, and early detection of potential issues.

                        To further enhance their outreach efforts, the association collaborates with local schools,
                        community centers, and
                        grassroots organizations. By working closely with these entities, they aim to integrate vocal
                        health education into the
                        broader framework of community well-being. This holistic approach ensures that individuals not
                        only receive medical
                        services when needed but also gain the knowledge and skills to proactively care for their vocal
                        health.</p>

                            The Vocal Health and Research Association is a legally registered
                            organization under the Companies Act 2013. Its aim is to promote
                            the WHO concept of opening medical centers in rural areas to
                            empower underprivileged sections of rural areas in India. They have
                            established their first center, "Vocal Swasthya Kendra," in
                            Garhmukteshwar, Hapur, to provide healthcare services to rural
                            populations at minimal or no cost. The organization is on a mission
                            to provide healthcare access to millions of people who are
                            deprived of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Vocal Health and Research Association is unique in its
                            approach to healthcare because it recognizes that access to
                            medical services is a basic human right. Furthermore, the
                            organization believes that vocal health is integral to overall health
                            and wellbeing. As such, they have made it their mission to provide
                            healthcare services that specifically cater to the vocal health needs
                            of rural populations.</p>

                    <h3>Our Mission :</h3>
                    <img src="assets/img/vil4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-4 mb-4" alt="">
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="properAlign">More than two-thirds of Indians live in villages, but the healthcare
                        facilities in these areas are yet to show the progress seen in urban
                        areas. The chances of you going to a rural health facility without a
                        doctor or a health professional is still very high in the country. The
                        analysis of the data available with the Ministry of Health and Family
                        Welfare tells us that things are way worse than they used to be 17
                        years ago, in 2005. As per Rural Health Statistics, 2014, there is a
                        shortfall of 36346 Sub Health Centers (SCs), 6700 Primary Health
                        Centers (PHCs), and 2350 Community Health Centers (CHCs) against
                        the specified population norm. As per Rural Health Statistics Bulletin
                        (RHS) 2014, a total of 2225 (8.89%) Primary Health Centers (PHCs) are
                        functioning without doctor, 9825 (39.26%) PHCs without Lab
                        Technician and 5739 (22.94%) PHCs without a pharmacist in the
                        country.</p>
                    <p class="properAlign">This lack of healthcare facilities in rural areas has resulted in a
                        significant disparity in the health outcomes of urban and rural
                        populations. People in rural areas are more vulnerable to diseases
                        due to poor sanitation, lack of clean drinking water, and malnutrition.
                        The shortage of medical professionals has also led to a lack of
                        awareness about preventive healthcare measures. As a result,
                        preventable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrhea
                        continue to claim many lives in rural India. To address this issue, the
                        government has launched various initiatives such as the National
                        Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and Ayushman Bharat. However, there is
                        still a long way to go to bridge the gap in healthcare facilities
                        between rural and urban areas. It is crucial to prioritize the
                        development of healthcare infrastructure in rural areas to ensure
                        access to quality healthcare for all.</p>

                    <h3>Problem Justification</h3>
                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Limited resources: </h5> Rural areas often have limited resources and
                    healthcare facilities. Many rural communities lack adequate
                    hospitals, clinics, and medical personnel. This means that people
                    in rural areas may have to travel long distances to receive medical
                    care, which can be especially challenging during a pandemic.</p>

                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Increased healthcare needs: </h5> The pandemic has led to increased
                    healthcare needs across the board, and rural communities are no
                    exception. In fact, rural communities may be even more vulnerable
                    to the pandemic due to a lack of access to healthcare and other
                    resources</p>

                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Higher risk populations: </h5> Rural communities often have higher
                    populations of older adults and people with underlying health
                    conditions, which put them at a higher risk for severe illness and
                    death from COVID19.</p>

                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Economic challenges: </h5> Rural areas have been hard hit by the
                    economic impacts of the pandemic, with many people losing their
                    jobs or experiencing reduced hours. This can make it even more
                    difficult for people in rural areas to access healthcare, especially if
                    they can't afford to travel long distances or pay for medical care.</p>

                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Mental health: </h5> The pandemic has also taken a toll on people's
                    mental health, and this is especially true for people in rural areas.
                    The isolation and lack of access to mental health services in rural
                    areas can exacerbate mental health issues.</p>

                    <p class="properAlign">
                    <h5>Awareness: </h5> Health knowledge awareness of rural residents was
                    quite low and the way of receiving health knowledge was simple
                    and traditional. One of the critical factors was education level.
                    Direct results showed that lower income families always obtained
                    higher health knowledge level than the rich families.</p>

                            The healthcare facilities in rural areas in India have not advanced as
                            much as urban areas. Data from the Ministry of Health and Family
                            Welfare show that the situation has worsened since 2005, with a
                            shortage of sub health centers, primary health centers, and community
                            health centers. Many primary health centers are operating without
                            doctors, lab technicians, and pharmacists. With nearly 69% of India's
                            population living in rural areas, healthcare services in these areas need
                            to be improved. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the
                            challenges faced by rural healthcare systems.
                        </p>
                        <h3>SCENARIO</h3>
                        <p class="properAlign">Overall, the pandemic has highlighted the need for increased
                            attention and resources for rural healthcare. It's important that we
                            address the challenges faced by rural communities and work to
                            ensure that everyone has access to the medical care they need,
                            regardless of where they live. Also, according to the recently
                            released Rural Health Statistics 2021-22, community health centres
                            (CHCs), primary health centres (PHCs), and health subcenters
                            (SCs) all operated with staffing levels that were lower than even
                            those of the year before, 2020 sub-centres-21. This has led to
                            disparities in access to healthcare and health outcomes between
                            rural and urban areas. This is a major issue for the VHRA, as we are
                            working to bridge the gap between these centres and their
                            required staffing levels in order to provide better care to those
                            living in rural and remote areas. Considering the current rural
                            healthcare services in India, we look forward to solving the existing
                            problems and bringing about a revolutionary change in the
                            healthcare system by introducing these innovative measures.

                        <p class="properAlign">Therefore, Vocal Health and Research Association is attempting to
                            establish 1000 general healthcare centres in rural areas in the next
                            3-5 years, that will provide multidisciplinary healthcare services.
                            The organisation is aimed at helping poor and disabled people
                            with innovative healthcare programmes. At every rural population
                            of 3000-5000 people, VHRA aims to establish 1 general healthcare
                            centre with high skilled professionals and cutting-edge technology.
                            VHRA believes that by making these healthcare centres available,
                            rural India will benefit from increased access to high-quality,
                            comprehensive health services. These centres will concentrate on
                            providing healthcare services to those in the greatest need. VHRA
                            will achieve this by providing cutting-edge medical technology
                            and access to skilled healthcare professionals.
